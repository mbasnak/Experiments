Fly 1 (60D05_7f, 2 days old)

I accidentaly punctured her thorax while doing the dissection.
She's not really walking.
Her PB signal looks great, but for some reason the 3x zoom looks like what 6x should look like, so I'm imaging at 3x.
I wasn't able to tild the arena because the fly holder is in the way. Hopefully the new holders will get at this.
I'm imaging at 10% laser power, with the PMT gain set at 800 V.


I run a 400 sec session of pattern 57 in closed loop.
The fly isn't moving.




Fly 2 (60D05_7f, 1 day old)

She moves when the LED is on, but is not really moving after that.
Her PB signal looks really good.
I am imaging with a 12% laser power and a gain of 700 V.
The zoom now looks ok again.


I run a 30 sec session with the panels in closed loop to make sure they are working.
She doesn't really move.

I then run a 400 sec session with the panels in closed loop.
She starts walking very nicely!

200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0.3 L. She walks well and very straight, with the nozzle in the front.
200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0.7 L. Again, very straight, wind up front.
200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0 L.
200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0.5 L. She's not moving much.
200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0.1 L. She's still very good at keeping it in the front.
200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0.05 L. She got a bit worse, but still pretty good.
200 sec closed loop wind with airflow at 0.02 L. fictrac malfunctioned, so I run it again. Here the fly's trajectory deteriorates a bit.

Panels in open loop with pattern 57:
-function 55
-function 208
-function 210
-52. It's hard to see the bump moving in this fly.
-206
-215
-212
-209
-207
-54
-213.
-214. imaging failed, so I run it again.
-211. imaging matlab failed, so I run it again. The imaging resolution was to high and the rate too low, so I ran it again. The phase was terrible.



Fly 3 (60D05_7f, 1 day old)

She is walking pretty well.
Her PB signal looks really good.
I am imaging with a 12% laser power and a gain of 700 V.

I run a 30 sec session with the panels in closed loop to make sure they are working.
I run a 400 sec session with the panels in closed loop. She's nicely active! Her PB signal looks good, although I'm not seing a bump that clearly. There is a little brain movement but it's not bad.

Closed-loop wind bouts (200 sec each):
-0 L/min. fictrac malfunctioned. I run another, 100 sec long session. There is quite a bit of brain movement. fictrac malfunctioned again.
I re run it once more.
-0.1
-0.02
-0.3
-0.05

Open-loop panel bouts, function #:
-215
-207
-206
-213
-54
-209
-212. I closed the plot before time, so I ran it again.
-52
-211
-214
-53
-208
-55
(I might have used 55 at some point in the middle too).


-100 sec closed loop session with pattern 57 to see how she does.
She walks super straight!
