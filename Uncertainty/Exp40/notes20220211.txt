Notes 20220211

Fly 1
She's not very active when I first put her on the ball, so I give her some time.
she gets the following order:
darkness / bar / wind / darkness / wind / bar
After some time, she's walking well in bouts, so I start.
She gets the darkness bout first.
She then gets the bright bar. she stops more frequently with the bar than she did in darkness, and stays still for long bouts.
She then gets the wind. she's not moving.
I run the darkness bout again, but she's still not moving, so I take her out.


Fly 2
She's not very active on her own, but gets active when the laser is on.
Her PB signal is great.
I run the protocol in the order in which the other fly was going to get it.
She gets 400 sec of darkness first.
She walked very little, but I keep going to see if the stimuli will get her to walk.
400 sec bright bar.
