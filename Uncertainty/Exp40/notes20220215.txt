Notes 20220215

Fly 1
She's not active on her own. She moves when I turn the LED or laser on, but awkwardly.
Beautiful PB signal.

She will get the stim in this order:
wind, darkness, bar, bar, wind, darkness

After a few minutes, I give her the wind bout, to see if that will get her to walk.
She didn't walk, so I repeat it.
she only walks at cue offset, so I take her out.


Fly 2
She's sprinting from the get go.
Her PB signal looks great.
I give her the stimuli in the order obtained for the last fly:

wind
darkness
bar: she's stopping a lot more at this point I think. There is some brain motion.
bar: she doesn't walk at all.
wind: she doesn't walk.

Since she stopped walking, I'm going to take her out, and use only the initial 3 trials (which might not be great, since the first one is usually worst, so I will see)


fly 3
She's somewhat active.
Her left glomeruli look a bit dim.
she gets the following order:
darkness, bar, wind, bar, darkness, wind.

darkness: she barely walks, so I re run it.
She's not walking, so I take her out.
