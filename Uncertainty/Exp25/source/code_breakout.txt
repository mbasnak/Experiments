Code - contrast change experiment

1) Pre-processing code
-ROI selector: GUI to select PB ROIs for posterior analysis
-ROI analysis: pre-processing code to take the registered images and obtain the intensity of the imaging channels from the ROIs selected in the previous step
-PB data analysis: pre-processing code to compute the df/f, obtain the bump's phase, and the behavioral variables in relevant units, as well as computing the offset.
-run_pre_analysis: function to automatically run the previous two codes on all the sessions of a given fly

2) Offset stabilizer block analysis
-offset_stabilizer_block: code to analyze the offset stabilizer session of a given fly
-run_offset_stabilizer_block_analysis: code to run the previous analysis on all the flies of the dataset

3) Closed loop block analysis
-closed_loop_analysis: code to analyze the closed loop session of a given fly
-run_closed_loop_analysis: code to analyze the closed-loop session of all flies in the dataset (this is currently not working... it gets stuck with fly 2 for some reason).
-closed_loop_group_analysis: code to analyze the group results for the closed-loop session. 
-bump_stability: code to analyze the effect of bump magnitude on bump stability, and comparing it to a laser power control

4) Open loop block analysis
-open_loop_analysis: code to analyze the open loop session of a given fly
-run_open_loop_analysis: code to run the previous analysis on all the flies of the dataset.
-open_loop_group_analysis: code to analyze the group results for the open loop sessions.

5) Cue weights model
-offset_verifyier_block: code to analyze the last sessions and obtain the verifying offset.
-run_offset_verifier_block_analysis: code to run the previous analysis on all the flies of the dataset.
-inclusion_criterion: code that compares the reference offset and the verifier offset to decide if they are close enough to keep this animal.
-plot_model: code to plot the results of the model where we compare beta internal and beta visual
