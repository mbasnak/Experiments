Notes 20220217

Fly 1
She's very small.
She's very active when I first put her on, but stops walking a few min in.
Her signal is not the best, but it's ok, I can distinguish the EB and the right bulb.
I run the cue combination experiment with her. She gets the bar first.
She's not really moving. She starts moving a bit around sec 400 but moves very little.
She moves a little when the wind comes on.



Fly 2
Also very small, also very active when I put her on.
It seems like there is a small leak in the holder and one of her front legs is attached to it.
Since she has good signal and is active, I still run the protocol.
She gets the wind first.
The leak is not that small, so I take her out.
